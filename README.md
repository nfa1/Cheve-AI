### Cheve-AI x Crunchbase: Gen Z Angels ðŸš€

Thrilled to share insights from a [Crunchbase article](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/gen-z-angel-investing/) about the rise of Gen Z angels in the investment landscape. Young investors like Joe Niehaus are making impactful moves, finding opportunities through channels like Gen Z VCs. The barriers to entry have lowered, allowing a new generation to engage in early-stage investing.

The article also highlights the changing landscape of angel investing, with platforms like AngelList and Republic making it accessible for those with diverse capital levels. The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in creating more awareness and accessibility, pushing young investors to explore opportunities beyond traditional avenues.

Angel investing does come with risks, but the potential for significant returns is driving the enthusiasm. As Gen Z shapes the future, having their perspective on the cap table adds unique value.
